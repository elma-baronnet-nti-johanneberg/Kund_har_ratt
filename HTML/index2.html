            Certainly! Here's a slightly longer version:
            
            Karin Boye (1900–1941) was a celebrated Swedish poet, novelist, and essayist known for her deeply emotional and existential works. Her poetry, including the renowned “Ja visst gör det ont” (Yes, It Hurts), reflects themes of personal growth, pain, and transformation, resonating with readers across generations.
            
            Boye’s dystopian novel “Kallocain” (1940) is a seminal work in speculative fiction, offering a chilling vision of a totalitarian future, often compared to Orwell’s 1984. Her writing captures the complexities of the human condition with a rare lyrical beauty.
            
            Though her life was tragically short, ending in 1941, Boye’s literary legacy continues to inspire, solidifying her place as one of Sweden’s most influential writers.</p>
